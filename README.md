# Three-Good-Things

A simple android app which enables and motivates users to record three good things every day. It is based on a positive psychology exercise scientifically proven to decrease anxiety, stress and depression.

* The date of the day and the three good things of the day are stored permanently in an SQLite database.

* The application allows the user to add an entry to the diary, updates an entry (change good things/date) or even deletes an entry.

* The application allows only one entry for a particular date.
